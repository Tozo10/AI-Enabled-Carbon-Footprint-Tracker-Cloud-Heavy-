# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Project Description
The AI-Enabled Carbon Footprint Tracker is an intelligent, cloud-native web application designed to empower individuals to take meaningful climate action. The platform allows users to effortlessly track, understand, and reduce their daily carbon footprint by logging activities like travel and energy consumption through intuitive text or voice commands.

This project goes beyond simple calculation by creating an engaging user experience that fosters long-term, eco-friendly habits. It aims to make sustainability accessible, data-driven, and motivating for everyone.

Key Features:

AI-Powered Input: Leverages IBM Watson for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech-to-Text, allowing users to log activities naturally (e.g., "I drove my car 15 km today").


Personalized Insights: Provides users with real-time feedback, data visualizations, and personalized sustainability tips based on their highest-impact activities.




Gamification Engine: Incorporates badges, streaks, and leaderboards to motivate users and encourage consistent engagement with their environmental goals.



Modern Serverless Architecture: Built on a highly scalable and efficient serverless backend using IBM Cloud Functions, a React frontend, and an IBM Cloudant NoSQL database.
