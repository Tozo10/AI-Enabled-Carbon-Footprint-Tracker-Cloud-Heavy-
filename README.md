AI-Powered Input: Leverages IBM Watson for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech-to-Text, allowing users to log activities naturally (e.g., "I drove my car 15 km today").


Personalized Insights: Provides users with real-time feedback, data visualizations, and personalized sustainability tips based on their highest-impact activities.




Gamification Engine: Incorporates badges, streaks, and leaderboards to motivate users and encourage consistent engagement with their environmental goals.



Modern Serverless Architecture: Built on a highly scalable and efficient serverless backend using IBM Cloud Functions, a React frontend, and an IBM Cloudant NoSQL database.
